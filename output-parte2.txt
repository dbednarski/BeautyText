In the beginning God created the heavens
and   the  earth.   Now  the  earth  was
formless  and empty,  darkness was  over
the  surface of the deep, and the Spirit
of  God was  hovering over  the  waters.

And  God said, "Let there be light," and
there  was light. God saw that the light
was  good, and  he separated  the  light
from  the darkness. God called the light
"day,"   and  the   darkness  he  called
"night."  And  there  was  evening,  and
there  was  morning  -  the  first  day.
