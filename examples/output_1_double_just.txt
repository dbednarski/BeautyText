When   on   board   H.M.S.   Beagle,   as
naturalist,   I  was  much  struck   with
certain  facts in the distribution of the
inhabitants  of South America, and in the
geological  relations of  the present  to
the  past inhabitants of that  continent.
These  facts seemed to  me to throw  some
light   on  the  origin  of  species—that
mystery  of  mysteries,  as  it has  been
called    by   one   of   our    greatest
philosophers.   On  my  return  home,  it
occurred  to me, in 1837, that  something
might   perhaps  be  made  out  on   this
question  by  patiently accumulating  and
reflecting  on all  sorts of facts  which
could  possibly have  any bearing on  it.
After  five years’ work I allowed  myself
to  speculate on the subject, and drew up
some  short  notes; these  I enlarged  in
1844  into a  sketch of the  conclusions,
which then seemed to me probable.

From  that period  to the  present day  I
have  steadily pursued the same object. I
hope  that I may be excused for  entering
on  these  personal  details,  as I  give
them  for the sake of showing that I have
not  been hasty in coming to a  decision.
My  work is now  nearly finished; but  as
it  will take me two or three more  years
to  complete it, and as my health is  far
from   strong,  I  have  been  urged   to
publish   this  Abstract.  I  have   more
especially  been induced  to do this,  as
Mr.  Wallace,  who  is  now studying  the
natural     history    of    the    Malay
Archipelago,   has   arrived  at   almost
exactly   the  same  general  conclusions
that I have on the origin of species.

Last  year he sent to me a memoir on this
subject,  with  a  request  that I  would
forward  it  to  Sir  Charles Lyell,  who
sent  it to the  Linnean Society, and  it
is  published in the third volume of  the
Journal  of  that Society.  Sir C.  Lyell
and  Dr.  Hooker,  who  both  knew of  my
work—the  latter having read my sketch of
1844—honoured    me   by   thinking    it
advisable  to publish, with Mr. Wallace’s
excellent  memoir,  some  brief  extracts
from my manuscripts.
